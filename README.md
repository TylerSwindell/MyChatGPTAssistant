## Overview

The `Session` class in `Session.class.ts` is a fundamental part of the session management system. It allows you to create, save, and delete chat sessions with the AI chatbot. You can also interact with the chatbot by sending and receiving messages.

The `index.ts` file provides a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with and manage these chat sessions.

## Files

### Session.class.ts

This TypeScript file contains the `Session` class, which is the core component of the session management system. It includes methods for creating sessions, saving sessions to disk, deleting sessions, and interacting with the AI chatbot.

#### Capabilities

The `Session.Class.ts` module is designed to manage chat sessions with an AI chatbot, utilizing the OpenAI GPT-3 API. It provides the following capabilities:

1. **Session Creation**: You can create new chat sessions using the `generateSession` function. It allows you to specify an optional `ChatLog` object to initialize the session with specific parameters. If not provided, a default session is created.

2. **Session Persistence**: The module allows you to save sessions to the local file system using the `saveSession` function. This is useful for keeping a record of your interactions with the chatbot.

3. **Session Deletion**: You can delete a session using the `deleteSession` function. This removes the session file from the local file system.

4. **Interacting with the Chatbot**: The `Session` class enables you to interact with the chatbot by sending messages and receiving responses. You can use the `ask` method to send a user message to the chatbot and get a response.

5. **Session Information Retrieval**: You can retrieve various information about the session, such as the chat log, title, ID, start date, and more.

#### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `Session.Class.ts` module:

**1. Creating a New Session:**

```typescript
import { generateSession } from "./Session.class.ts";

// Create a new session
const session = generateSession();

// Optionally, you can specify initial chat messages when creating the session:
const initialMessages = [
  { role: "user", content: "Hello, chatbot!" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Hi there! How can I assist you?" },
];

const sessionWithInitialMessages = generateSession({
  messages: initialMessages,
});
```

**2. Sending a Message to the Chatbot:**

```typescript
import Session from "./Session.class.ts";

// Assuming you have an existing session
const session = new Session();

// Send a message to the chatbot
const userMessage = "Tell me a joke!";
const response = await session.ask(userMessage);

console.log("Chatbot's response:", response.content);
```

**3. Retrieving Session Information:**

```typescript
// Assuming you have an existing session
const session = new Session();

// Get session information
const chatLog = session.getLog();
const sessionTitle = session.getTitle();
const sessionId = session.getID();
const startDate = session.getStartDate();

console.log("Session Title:", sessionTitle);
console.log("Session ID:", sessionId);
console.log("Session Start Date:", new Date(startDate).toLocaleString());
console.log("Chat Log:", chatLog);
```

**4. Saving and Deleting Sessions:**

```typescript
import Session, { saveSession, deleteSession } from "./Session.class.ts";

// Assuming you have an existing session
const session = new Session();

// Save the session to the local file system
const isSaved = saveSession(session);

if (isSaved) {
  console.log("Session saved successfully.");
} else {
  console.error("Failed to save the session.");
}

// Delete the session from the local file system
const isDeleted = deleteSession(session);

if (isDeleted) {
  console.log("Session deleted successfully.");
} else {
  console.error("Failed to delete the session.");
}
```

These examples demonstrate how to create, interact with, and manage chat sessions using the `Session.Class.ts` module. You can customize your sessions, send messages to the chatbot, and persist session data as needed.
